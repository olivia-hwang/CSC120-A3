Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Yuli Qin, Amber Zhang
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
2/15 Evening TA hours
- What are your initial impressions of Java?
Java feels less intuitive than Python. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Pseudocode mostly works the same between the two languages, and many of the differences are in syntax. Java makes it easier to pinpoint what object/method from which class to use, but in turn is a little less easier to understand. Programming in general is similar to learning a language, and you need to approach programming by trying to understand what the computer is interpreting.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Going to TA hours when I first started the assignment was a good idea, since it helped me understand how to structure my code better. I might read the README beforehand in more depth to understand what the hard parts of the assignment might be.
